# awtrix-case
> The current status of the project is **work in progress** - No prototype was built, no precise measurement was done. It is still in the beginning, but I keep you updated. Check out the roadmap!

## Motivation
Once upon a time I found this cool project called [Awtrix](https://docs.blueforcer.de/#/v2/README) by [blueforcer](https://github.com/Blueforcer), fell in love with it instantly, started buying parts and solder them together. The first plan was to 3D-print the chassis like it's mentioned in the documentation, but then the slicing program told me the biggest piece takes 20 hours to print... A guy in the makerspace I am building this thing said to me "Why do you want to waste mineral oil in plastic form if you can build your box with wood? We have a laser cutter btw." And I thought why not!

## The plan
The plan is pretty simple: Cut multiple layers of 4mm wooden sheets, stack and combine them with glue, nuts and bolts. In the end you should have a nice clean wooden front and back and marbled sides because of the edges of the wooden pieces. The last step would be sandpaper and a nice varnish to finish things off - Everybody can print things!

The images/schematics can be found in the directory [/svg](/svg). 

## Roadmap
- ~~📝 Draw/generate the svg files~~
- 🎛 Cut the first parts and tweak the parameters if needed
- 🛠 Build the first prototype
- 🖼 Upload fotos of the make
- 📔 Create a nice documentation
